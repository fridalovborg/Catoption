“Adopt don’t shop” - Team Catoption

Together with four members of team Catoption, we created a campaign to promote animal welfare center for homeless cats. In Sweden, there are about 100 000 homeless cats and thousands of cats are abandoned by their owners each year. Catoption’s vision is to adopt instead of buying. 

The webpage is made from scratch with Tween Max animation, JS effects, Google maps- & Instagram Api.
